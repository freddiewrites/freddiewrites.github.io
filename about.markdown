**I'm a writer turned full-stack marketer who cares about making things simple, accessible and human.**

Right now I lead on product marketing for [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com), where we're helping people to design better products.

I work remotely but live in Buckinghamshire (UK) with my lovely wife and son. When I'm not working, I'm reading, walking, lifting weights, or fussing over my morning coffee.

I call myself a full-stack marketer because I can do a bit of everything — from writing copy to building out multi-channel marketing campaigns.

Of all the skills I've been lucky enough to practice over the last decade, writing is what I love to do the most — whether that's internal comms, a clear marketing plan, a blog post, a video treatment or an email.

I believe that putting your audience — or your customer — at the heart of what you do matters more than anything else. That means talking about what they care about. If you're doing things right, you'll be talking about you care about at the same time.

I love working as part of a team, drawing on everyone's unique experiences and skills to create something great. I'm definitely a practical, hands-on type, though. You won't find me standing in the sidelines, hoping for the best. I prefer to get stuck in and make things every project as good as it can be.

Learning about how something works and teaching it to others gives me a lot of satisfaction. I'm always up for sharing what I've learnt, be it with customers or colleagues.

Previously, I was a senior writer at [Sideshow](https://www.sideshowagency.com/), a freelance copywriter, and a web editor for [Arts University Bournemouth](https://aub.ac.uk/).

As a journalism graduate from [Bournemouth University](https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/), I got my start as a Staff Writer for iCreate Magazine where I co-authored the iTunes bestseller [iCloud for Beginners](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/icloud-for-beginners/id497723676?mt=11). I left iCreate as Features Editor.

I've spent countless (enjoyable) hours making websites easier to read and navigate, led on an award-winning app launch, and wrote for two of the UK's top ten most valuable brands.

My work has won awards from Computer Arts, the Chartered Institute of Marketing and HEIST, among others.
