**I'm a writer turned full-stack marketer who cares about making things simple, accessible and human.**

I’ve spent over a decade using words to make things simple, accessible, and human. In that time I’ve worked for universities, charities, tech products, and two of the UK’s most valuable brands.

Right now I lead on product marketing for [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com), where we're helping people to design better products.

I work remotely but live in Buckinghamshire (UK) with my lovely wife and son. When I'm not working, I'm reading, walking, lifting weights, or nerding out about making coffee.

Previously, I was a senior writer at Sideshow (now [Gain](https://www.thisisgain.com)), a freelance copywriter, and a web editor for [Arts University Bournemouth](https://aub.ac.uk/).

As a journalism graduate from [Bournemouth University](https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/), I cut my teeth at iCreate Magazine, where I co-authored the iTunes bestseller [iCloud for Beginners](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/icloud-for-beginners/id497723676?mt=11) and worked my way up to Features Editor.

My work has won awards from Computer Arts, the Chartered Institute of Marketing and HEIST, among others.
