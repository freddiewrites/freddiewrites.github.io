**I’m a writer living by the sea. Making stuff easier for people to understand gets me out of bed in the morning.**

I lead on copywriting and content strategy for [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/). When I’m not at work, I co-host [Episode Party](https://www.episode.party/) – a podcast where two hosts and one guest chat about three of our favourite podcasts.

Previously, I was a senior writer at [Sideshow](https://www.sideshowagency.com/), a freelance copywriter, and a web editor for [Arts University Bournemouth](https://aub.ac.uk/). In that time, I re-launched the university’s website, worked on the app won the Chair’s Grand Prix at the CIM Marketing Excellence Awards, and wrote for two of the UK’s top ten most valuable brands.

I cut my teeth in publishing, starting out as Staff Writer and quickly rising to Features Editor at iCreate Magazine. While I was there, I co-authored the iTunes bestseller [iCloud for Beginners](https://books.apple.com/us/book/icloud-for-beginners/id497723676).

My work has won awards from Computer Arts, the Chartered Institute of Marketing and HEIST, among others. But more importantly, it’s left a little less jargon in the world.
