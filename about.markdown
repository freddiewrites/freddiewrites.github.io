**I'm a writer who cares about making things simple, accessible and human. Making stuff easier for people to understand gets me out of bed in the morning.**

Right now I lead on copy and content strategy for [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com), where we're helping people to design better products.

When I'm not working, I'm reading, walking, running, at the gym, or figuring out how to keep my sourdough starter alive.

Great writing starts from a place of empathy, so my work often begins with getting to know the people who will read it.

I'm happy to go and do my own research, but equally able to work with in-house researchers and stakeholders to figure out what matters.

By taking what I've learnt and backing it with a sound strategy, I'm able to write in a way that gets to the heart of what readers and businesses want (even if they're not always aligned).

Some people call what I do content design, UX writing, or copywriting. I call it all writing because that's the one distant family members understand the best.

Previously, I was a senior writer at [Sideshow](https://www.sideshowagency.com/), a freelance copywriter, and a web editor for [Arts University Bournemouth](https://aub.ac.uk/).

I cut my teeth in publishing, starting out as a Staff Writer and leaving as Features Editor for iCreate Magazine and co-author of the iTunes bestseller [iCloud for Beginners](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/icloud-for-beginners/id497723676?mt=11).

I've spent countless (enjoyable) hours making websites easier to read and navigate, led on an award-winning app launch, and wrote for two of the UK’s top ten most valuable brands.

My work has won awards from Computer Arts, the Chartered Institute of Marketing and HEIST, among others.
