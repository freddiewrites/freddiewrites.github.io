After almost two years of working for myself, I’m super happy to be heading back into an office every day. I’m joining the wonderful folks at [Sideshow](https://www.sideshowagency.com/) and I couldn’t be more excited.

After spending a few months contracting for them on various jobs, it became abundantly clear that the folk at Sideshow were the kind of people I wanted to spend more time with. So that’s exactly what I’m doing. Have I told you I’m excited? Because I’m excited.

If you’re in need of a freelance writer for a project, I can happily recommend you a few. Just send me an email. Or perhaps you’d be interested in the services of [a rather excellent agency](https://www.sideshowagency.com/)?
