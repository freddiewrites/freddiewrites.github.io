After almost two fantastic years working for [Sideshow](https://www.sideshowagency.com/), I’m incredibly excited to be joining the team at [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/).

I worked with Sketch [back in 2017](https://freddiewrit.es/sketch/) on some of their web and blog copy and I’m looking forward to doing a whole lot more of that. It also gives me an opportunity to rebuild my old sit-stand desk and set up a new home office down on the South Coast.
