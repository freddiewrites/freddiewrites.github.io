excerpt: I wrote a guide that covers everything you need to know about writing, designing and delivering perfect presentations.
---
Around the tail-end of 2016 I had a spare week between client contracts, so I decided to use that time to scratch my own itch. To me, that meant sitting down to start writing a short book I’d sketched out about a year earlier.

I’m a sucker for a great presentation. I watch Apple’s keynotes religiously and I’m forever amazed by the mystical, magical powers of by Apple’s Keynote. Yes, those are two different things.

Anyway, having put together a few presentations (for myself and previous employers), the ego in me decided that I knew what worked and what didn’t. And that’s how [The Perfect Presentation Playbook](https://gumroad.com/l/pbook) was born.

> **“The Perfect Presentation Playbook is your guide to writing, designing and delivering perfect presentations. Whether you’re working on a motivational speech, a new product announcement or your company’s fourth quarter financial results, the ideas in this ebook will help you create a presentation to remember.”**

All told, it took me about a month and a half to write. I’d get up early and write for an hour or two before I started a day’s worth of client work. Then I commissioned designer and illustrator [Daniel Duke](https://www.danielduke.me/) to bring it all together. I’m also forever indebted to my podcasting co-host and editor of [ATTN:Magazine](https://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/), Jack Chuter, who proofed the whole thing.

The final result was a 47-page guide to structuring, writing, designing and presenting a perfect presentation. It was a lot of fun to put together, especially when it came to articulating all the little things I’ve instinctually included in presentations over the years without really realising.

The hardest part of the whole project wasn’t writing the book, though. It was getting it ready for digital distribution. I went down the ebook route (because printing physical copies was too expensive, even with print-on-demand) and boy oh boy was there a lot to consider…

If you’d like to see the final product for yourself, [you can buy a copy](https://gumroad.com/l/pbook). For your hard-earned cash, you’ll get a PDF, Kindle and generic ebook file as an instant download.
