**I'm a writer who cares about making things simple, accessible and human. Making stuff easier for people to understand gets me out of bed in the morning.**

Right now I lead on copy and content strategy for [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com), where we're helping people to design better products.

When I'm not working, I'm reading, walking, running, at the gym, or figuring out why I keep killing my sourdough starter.
