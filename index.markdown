Hello 👋 I'm Freddie Harrison. I’m a writer, accidental marketer and former technology journalist. I currently lead marketing at [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/).

Here, I write about what I’ve been thinking, seeing and reading. You can also [read more about me](/about) and find out [what I’m doing now](/now), if that’s your thing.
